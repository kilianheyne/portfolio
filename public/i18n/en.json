        "aboutThisProject": "This Pokédex is a self-built web app that fetches and displays data from the public PokéAPI. Users can scroll through a growing list of Pokémon, view detailed stats, and explore types and base values — all built without any frameworks, using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.",
        "howIOrganised": "I began with a clean HTML and CSS layout to establish the basic structure and responsive design. Then I implemented API integration using JavaScript, including dynamic loading, error handling, and a modular code structure for better reusability and clarity. UI improvements and testing were done iteratively during development.",
        "learnings": "This project strengthened my understanding of asynchronous data handling with fetch, Promises, and async/await. I also improved my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and organizing code into modular functions — all while building a more complex app architecture from scratch."
    },
    "project_card_2": {
        "aboutThisProject": "“El Pollo Loco” is a custom-built 2D side-scrolling game created entirely with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a main character through an animated level, collecting items, avoiding hazards, and facing enemies — all enriched with sound effects, game logic, and win/loss conditions.",
        "howIOrganised": "I started by designing the game logic and implementing player controls and collision detection. Then I added animations, audio, and keyboard-based input. The project was gradually structured into classes and modules to keep the code clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.",
        "learnings": "This project deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, game loops, canvas rendering, and event-driven architecture. I also gained valuable experience in performance tuning and creating responsive, interactive gameplay."
    },
    "project_card_3": {
        "aboutThisProject": "Task manager inspired by the Kanban System. Create and organize tasks using drag and drop functions, assign users and categories.",
        "howIOrganised": "To keep the code clean and maintainable, I divided the project into reusable Angular components and services. Clear folder structures, meaningful variable and class names, and consistent formatting made the code easy to understand. Comments documented key functions, and recurring logic was outsourced in a modular fashion to avoid redundancies.",
        "groupWorkExperience": "We were a team of four people and worked in an agile manner with a clear division of tasks. My main responsibility was developing the summary view, the task board overview, and the filter functions. We used Angular, TypeScript, Firebase, and SCSS. Regular team meetings enabled us to quickly gather feedback and find solutions together."

    "project_card_4": {
        "aboutThisProject": "I am currently working on DA Bubble, a chat and collaboration platform similar to Slack. My focus is on implementing real-time communication features, an intuitive user interface, and high-performance data management. For me, the key to success is careful planning, clean code structure, and continuous testing to ensure high code quality. I also place great importance on constantly learning and applying new technologies and best practices—this keeps my development process innovative and efficient."
