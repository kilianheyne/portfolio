Users can scroll through a growing list of Pokémon, view detailed stats, and explore types and base values — all built without any frameworks, using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.",
        "howIOrganised": "I began with a clean HTML and CSS layout to establish the basic structure and responsive design. Then I implemented API integration using JavaScript, including dynamic loading, error handling, and a modular code structure for better reusability and clarity. UI improvements and testing were done iteratively during development.",
        "learnings": "This project strengthened my understanding of asynchronous data handling with fetch, Promises, and async/await. I also improved my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and organizing code into modular functions — all while building a more complex app architecture from scratch."

        "aboutThisProject": "“El Pollo Loco” is a custom-built 2D side-scrolling game created entirely with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

        "howIOrganised": "I started by designing the game logic and implementing player controls and collision detection. Then I added animations, audio, and keyboard-based input. The project was gradually structured into classes and modules to keep the code clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.",
        "learnings": "This project deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, game loops, canvas rendering, and event-driven architecture. I also gained valuable experience in performance tuning and creating responsive, interactive gameplay."
